**Location:** Ramu Cantonment, Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh
**Timeline:** December 2023 - December 2023

- **Project Description:** Build a web application to upscale your low-resolution image. To build the application, we will use Streamlit, which we can run on our local PC. You can also deploy the application to the Streamlit cloud server for free. For this development, I will only show you how you can use the [EDSR](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.02921.pdf) (Enhanced Deep Residual Networks for Single Image Super-Resolution) and [LapSRN](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.01992.pdf) (Laplacian Super Resolution Networks) trained models directly for your application and get the result.
