**Location:** Ramu Cantonment, Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh
**Timeline:** Obtober 2023 - October 2023

- **Project Description:** Our application aims to provide users with an intuitive way to interact with information contained in PDF documents. By uploading PDFs, users can ask questions about the content, and the application will provide relevant answers using a conversational AI model. This solution benefits users who need to extract information from complex documents quickly. For our development case, we will use [mistral.ai](https://mistral.ai/). Mistral AI is a revolutionary group that implemented small but powerful large language models you can use in your local machine. Unlike big corporations' handicap policies for mass NLP developers, they provide reasonable support and are available to download model weights.
