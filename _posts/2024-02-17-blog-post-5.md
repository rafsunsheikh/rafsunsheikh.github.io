Are you tired of spending hours training your own image classification models? Do you want a faster and easier way to classify your images with high accuracy? If so, you’re in luck! Introducing ptmodels, a Python package that provides pre-trained convolutional neural network models for image classification.

With ptmodels, you don’t need to spend hours training your own models from scratch. Instead, you can simply load your dataset, import pre-trained models, and start training. Our package includes all the pre-trained models you need to get started, and we provide performance metrics to help you evaluate the accuracy of your models.
