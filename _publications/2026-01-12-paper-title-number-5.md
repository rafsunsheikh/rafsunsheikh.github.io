excerpt: 'Managing financial regulatory compliance (FRC) presents significant challenges for Financial Technology (FinTech) organisations. Some challenges are due to both rapidly evolving environment and limitations of existing computational support. Although FinTech organisations continuously seek contemporary methods for Financial Risk Management, common issues persist with time-consuming and labor-intensive compliance processes. Previous Artificial Intelligence-driven approaches often lack comprehensive support for the dynamic nature of regulatory requirements. To address these gaps and leverage the increasing availability of regulatory and financial data, the study utilizes a design science research paradigm to design TRIAG (Tri-Reinforced Infused Generative Agents), an innovative computational framework grounded in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL). The TRIAG artifact is a prototype featuring three distinct Generative AI agents that autonomously acquire, refine, and coordinate domain-specific expertise related to FinTech regulatory compliance. The study’s evaluation, involving industry professionals in a workshop setting, demonstrates that TRIAG effectively enhances the efficiency and accuracy of compliance officers decision-making processes for FRC management tasks. This work introduces a novel MARL-guided, multi-GenAI agent system applied specifically to financial regulatory risk.'
